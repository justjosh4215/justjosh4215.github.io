## CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 is one of my favorite labs because the assignment was creating a program that allowed us to calculate the difference between two specific dates. It was exciting to see a program that was fun to mess around with. We also had to use Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithms in order to complete the program which was very cool to see.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was a fun assignment because it focused on making a sandwich order and blackjack. While I did find the coding for the blackjack to be difficult, the coding for the sandwich assignment was a fun to make and allowed up to make funny sandwich combinations. While it's not the most efficient program, I did enjoy on how silly it was. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 had the task of animating a gradient image. In order to program it, we had to write functions that would then create an image of colors. Even though it was a difficult lab, it was amazing to see the finished product.
